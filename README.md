# Detecting-Lanes-for-a-Self-Driving-Car

- A mini project with Image Processing
- Detecting lanes in a road to build a self driving agent for a simulator using basic Image Processing algorithms
- Used technologies : Python 3.6, OpenCV, Python Imaging Library (PIL) for capturing the computer screen and other necessary python libraries (NumPy)
- Text editors & IDEs : Python 3.6 64-bit IDLE- A mini project with Image Processing
